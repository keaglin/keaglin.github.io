# Named Improvements
------
Materialize
---
- carousel to display projects (where do descriptions go? on hover? next slide?)  
- pushpin for having nav on the bottom at page load then have it stick to the top  

# Other Stuff to Deal With
Footer  
Dim Hero gif  
Maybe darken background to continue the 'dark'/'lofi' theme?  
Contact form  


# Thoughts  
Make it a React app    
render everything on top of the gif/make the gif the background
Carousel for skills AND projects?
Modal for contact form?
