# Named Improvements
------
Materialize
---
- carousel to display projects (where do descriptions go? on hover? next slide?)  
- pushpin for having nav on the bottom at page load then have it stick to the top (on hold)  

# Other Stuff to Deal With
Footer--DONE(ish)  
Dim Hero gif--DONE  
Maybe darken background to continue the 'dark'/'lofi' theme?--DONE  
Contact form--DONE(ish)  


# Thoughts  
Make it a React app (negative)    
render everything on top of the gif/make the gif the background--DONE  
Carousel for skills AND projects? (in progress/next up)  
Modal for contact form? (Not at the moment)
