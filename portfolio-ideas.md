2. clear navigation (simple, consistent; maybe work/about/contact/blog)

TECHNICAL NOTES
body needs to be a flex container of columns for its children to stack (even though that's not what I want as an end result) and it needs to have a direction: column and justify-contents: space-between 

footer needs to be a flex container, justify-content: space-around
each thing should be like a flex item so I can space it nicely

each section should fill the viewport on its own (eg. work, about, whatevs)
